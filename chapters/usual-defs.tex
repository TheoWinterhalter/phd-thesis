\section{Inductive types}
\labsec{inductive-types}

\subsection{Simple types}

\todo{Not really simple, but only parameterised}
\todo{unit, bool, nat, lists, sigmas, prods and prods as sigmas}

\subsection{Indexed inductive types}
\todo{vectors}
\todo{Lead to equality}

\todo{Inductive Inductive/Recusrive? Probably irrelevant here}

\section{Coinductive types and records}

\section{Equality}
\labsec{equality-def}

\todo{This is not a debate about how to define it, we will show the Coq one
and refer to the next chapter to the discussion about its definition.}
\todo{UIP, funext, transport, heterogenous equality}

\acrfull{JMeq} introduced by
\sidecite{mcbride2000dependently} has axioms
instead better
\[ \Heq{T}{t}{U}{u} := \Sum{p:\Eq{}{T}{U}} \Eq{}{\transpo{p}\ t}{u}. \]
