\chapter{Desirable properties of type theories}
\labch{desirable-props}

To compare different type theories there are several measures we can use in
form of usual or desirable properties that they migh satisfy or not.
After a brief presentation of the main ones I will summarise which of the
theories of \vrefch{flavours} has which properties in a table.

\section{Properties}

\subsection{Weakening and substitutivity}

\todo{Also for reduction, conversion usually}

\subsection{Inversion of typing}
\todo{Not really a measure, it always makes sense in some way}
\todo{Merge with weak/subst?}

\subsection{Unique / principal typing}

\subsection{Properties of reduction}
\todo{Confluence, termination}

\subsection{Canonicity}

\subsection{Decidability of type checking}

\subsection{Consistency}
