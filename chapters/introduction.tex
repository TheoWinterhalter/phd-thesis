\section{Meta}

Nothing organised for now...

\paragraph{Things to put in (high level)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ETT to ITT
  \item ETT to Weak TT
  \item Coq Coq Correct
\end{itemize}
%
Probably merging the two firsts. Since there is a CPP article for ETT to ITT
it might be worth it to instead write a chapter on ETT to WTT and say we can
derive the other from WTT to ITT.
However, this would not allow me to really talk about the ``plugin''.

\paragraph{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Proof theory proof as object(?)
  \item Type theory
  \item Curry-Howard for SLT first?
  \item GÃ¶del?
  \item Why formalise type theory
  \item Dependent types (also for programming?)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Outline}

For now only three chapters excluding intro but it feels like there should be
more. Maybe these aren't chapters but parts.
The Card model for instance could be its own chapter.
HoTT should be mentioned to state ETT to ITT/WTT extends to 2TT/HTS.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Formalisation / Representation of Type Theories
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Translations: syntactical or not
      \item Annotations for applications etc (Card model?)
      \item MetaCoq / TemplateCoq?
    \end{itemize}
  \item Computation in Type Theory
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ETT, ITT, WTT
      \item Funext, UIP? (HoTT?)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Kernel of \Coq written in \Coq
\end{enumerate}
