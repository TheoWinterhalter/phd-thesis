\section{Meta}

Nothing organised for now...

\paragraph{Things to put in (high level)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ETT to ITT
  \item ETT to Weak TT
  \item Coq Coq Correct
\end{itemize}
%
Probably merging the two firsts. Since there is a CPP article for ETT to ITT
it might be worth it to instead write a chapter on ETT to WTT and say we can
derive the other from WTT to ITT.
However, this would not allow me to really talk about the ``plugin''.

\paragraph{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Proof theory proof as object(?)
  \item Type theory
  \item Curry-Howard for SLT first?
  \item GÃ¶del?
  \item Why formalise type theory
  \item Dependent types (also for programming?)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Outline}
