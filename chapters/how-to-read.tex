\chapter*{How to read this thesis}
\labch{how-to-read}

I believe that a document of this size will more often viewed on computer than
on paper. This how I personally view most papers I read anyway.
As such I believe that the document should be adapted for such a medium, unlike
most \LaTeX{} documents.
While trying to make my own kind of document I stumbled upon the great
\href{https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook/}{kaobook} class which corresponds
almost exactly to what I was looking for: citations, notes, reminders can be put
in a large margin.
