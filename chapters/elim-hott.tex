  \section{Extension: Translating HTS to 2TT}
  \label{sec:extens-transl-hts}

  \todo{Keep it as an easy extension? If so, we need to say more as this is no
  longer a direct application.}

  As we mentioned earlier, one of the interesting special cases covered by this
  translation is the translation from 2-level type theory with reflection
  (arguably a variant of Homotopy Type System~\sidecite{hts-sota} (HTS) to 2-level
  type theory~\sidecite{altenkirch2016extending} (2TT).
  %
  We thus use two hierarchies $(\F{i})_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$, universes of fibrant
  types, and $(\Un{i})_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$, universes of strict types.
  We give the following axioms for the sorts:
  %
  \begin{align*}
    (\F{i}, \F{i+1}) &\in \Ax \\
    (\Un{i}, \Un{i+1}) &\in \Ax \\
    (\F{i}, \F{j}, \F{\nmax{i}{j}}) &\in \Rl \\
    (\F{i}, \Un{j}, \Un{\nmax{i}{j}}) &\in \Rl \\
    (\Un{i}, \F{j}, \Un{\nmax{i}{j}}) &\in \Rl \\
    (\Un{i}, \Un{j}, \Un{\nmax{i}{j}}) &\in \Rl
  \end{align*}
  %
  We then equip our theory with a fibrant equality type defined as an inductive
  type and the proof takes care of it. We can also add any inductive type that we
  like, as for instance the natural numbers, the unit and empty types.
